    <h1>MovieFetcher API</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my MovieFetcher API documentation!</p>
    <p>I am creating a <span>movieAPI</span> for my application called <span>"MovieFetcher"</span> that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. The web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. </p>
