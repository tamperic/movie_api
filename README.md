# üé¨ MovieFetcher - Movie API

This is the backend project for a **movie database API** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to create or delete an account, log in, view list of all movies, get detailed information about movies, directors, genres, as well as to manage their favorite movies.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** - a JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side logic of the application.
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** - a NoSQL database used to store user and movie data, with Mongoose providing a schema-based modeling interface.
- Middlwares: **Morgan** - a logging middleware that outputs HTTP request details to the console for easy monitoring and debugging, **bodyParser** and **Express.js** - middlewares used to parse incoming request bodies (JSON and form data) so the server can access client input.
- **Passport.js** (Local and JWT Strategies) - handle user authentication securely.
- **Bcrypt** - a library used to hash user passwords before storing them in the database.
- **JSDoc** - for a clean documentation from code comments.
- **Express-Validator** - for an user's input validation.
- **Postman** - a tool used to test and visualize HTTP requests and responses during API development.
- **Heroku** - a cloud platform used to deploy and host the backend server so it's accessible online.
